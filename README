RIRC README

***INTRO***

RIRC is a Ruby/GTK client for irssi2 (http://main.irssi.org/projects/irssi2.html). It was the first irssi2 client written, and at the time of writing is the most full featured.

***LICENCING***
GPL - see COPYING FILE

***REQUIREMENTS***

RIRC requires:

Ruby
ruby-libglade2 (and its dependancies) http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp

The following are only needed for ssh support:
Net::SSH http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/
Needle http://needle.rubyforge.org/

***SETUP***

Untar the tarball somewhere
cd into the folder
edit config.rb.factory to your liking and rename it to config.rb.
run './main.rb' or 'ruby main.rb'

***USAGE***

This is a list of the supported commands and their parameters:

/server <name>:<address> (you cannot set the port currently)
/join <channel>
/part <channel>
/msg <user> <message> (you can send, but rirc will not handle incoming messages correctly ATM)
/quit (quit rirc, but leave irssi2 running)
/shutdown (quit rirc and kill irssi2)

/raw <command> (sends a raw command to irssi2, do NOT specify a tag)
/ruby <command> (sends a command to ruby's eval() function, if you break something using this, you get to keep all the pieces)

***TROUBLESHOOTING***

hahah, you're using pre alpha software, fix it yourself or bug me on #irssi2 on freenode

***SSH HOWTO***

RIRC now supports connecting to irssi2 via ssh. To do this you need to comply with a couple restrictions, as the ssh implementation assumes some things:

You must be using public/private key auth
Your key must not have a passphrase
Your key must be in the standard .ssh folder in your ~ folder

To activate support, simply edit the config file and set the method to ssh, and set the ip or address of the host.
If irssi2 is not in the $PATH on the host, use the ssh_binpath variable to set it

***CONTRIBUTING***

Anyone interested in helping is strongly encouraged to contact me. I could really use a second dev for this project.

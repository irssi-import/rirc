TODO

Big things:
    Dynamic scrollback fetching
    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Fixup the Net::SSH connection method for windows lusers and finish porting rirc to windows (if I can be bothered)
    Investigate dumping textview for some kind of line based, custom widget
    Clean up code, seperate functions into public/protected/private, standardize function/variable naming and lots more commenting (Ugh)
    Add a GUI for managing plugins, and hooks so plugins can be configured via a GUI
    
Little things:
    network buffers should also maybe do event get (really need cras to improve the LDAP filters for this)
    Make the right click menus more useful
    Make keybindings configurable
    NetSplit detection (might be better in irssi2 itself)
    Hide/Disconnect/Disconnect & Close All right click options for network tabs.
    /alias command...

Bugs:
    Selected text in the textview changes color when the textview isn't in focus, an ugly workaround hack is keeping this looking nice for now tho.
    Slight issues with scrolling to end when tab switching. This seems to ba caused by a resize when the userlist is hidden.... calling a scroll_to_end after a size renegoitiation seems to improve things
    Can't set colors for input from config as the cursor becomes hidden
    URLs sometimes get colored, need to use a different color tag format or escape message text somehow
    fails to catch nickname changes made by other clients... (investigate)
    client and nickname do not always match up
    newly added colors are not added to the tagtable.
    coloring timestamps adds weird spacing

TODO

Big things:
	Dynamic scrollback fetching
	On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
	Fixup the Net::SSH connection method for windows lusers
	Finish porting rirc to windows (if I can be bothered)
	
Little things:
	/msgs from other users should open a new tab at the end of the channel list for that network
	network buffers should also maybe do event get
	Search the logs to find user's hostname for event get events like /part and /join
	Tab completion
	Implement long format date
	Disable tab for input line
	
Bugs:
	You can untoggle the channel buttons without selecting a new channel
	Word wrap seems to flake out unless I use character splitting instead of word splitting (which I want) (this doesn't seem to be a problem anymore...)
	Disappearing nick bug (change nick from vag to vag2 for example)

TODO

Big things:
    Dynamic scrollback fetching
    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Fixup the Net::SSH connection method for windows lusers
    Finish porting rirc to windows (if I can be bothered)
    Plugin support?
	
Little things:
    network buffers should also maybe do event get

Bugs:
    Selected text in the textview changes color when the textview isn't in focus, an ugly workaround hack is keeping this looking nice for now tho.
    Word wrap seems to flake out unless I use character splitting instead of word splitting (which I want) (this doesn't seem to be a problem anymore...)
    messages/events from event get should not color the tab buttons
    fix tab completion weirdness

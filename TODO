TODO

Big things:
    Dynamic scrollback fetching
    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Investigate dumping textview for some kind of line based, custom widget (use SCW when its got a ruby binding)
    Clean up code, seperate functions into public/protected/private, standardize function/variable naming and lots more commenting (Ugh)
    
Little things:
    Make the right click menus more useful
    Make keybindings configurable
    NetSplit detection (might be better in irssi2 itself)
    Hide/Disconnect/Disconnect & Close All right click options for network tabs.
    "Diff" topics so you can see what changed...? (probably a plugin)
    pgup/down chat scrolling (wait for scw)

Bugs:
    Slight issues with scrolling to end when tab switching. This seems to ba caused by a resize when the userlist is hidden.... calling a scroll_to_end after a size renegoitiation seems to improve things
    Can't set colors for input from config as the cursor becomes hidden
    restoring colors from default doesn't work, the colors don't know they've been updated
    Can't select text in the msg window with text in the message entry

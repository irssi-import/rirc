TODO

Big things:
    Dynamic scrollback fetching
    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Clean up code, seperate functions into public/protected/private, standardize function/variable naming and lots more commenting (Ugh)
    
Little things:
    Make the right click menus more useful
    NetSplit detection (might be better in irssi2 itself)
    Hide/Disconnect/Disconnect & Close All right click options for network tabs.
    "Diff" topics so you can see what changed...? (probably a plugin)
    Possible bindable actions: Close tab, next tab, previous tab, move tab left, move tab right (problem is that you sort alphabetically, though). Close all tabs but current Close all tabs, disconnect. some kind of alias that lets you set a command to be sent on the current buffer...
    Add 'heavyweight' tab system and finish the 'lightweight' system
    Abstract the GUI off the core
    Add a proper interface for the scwview widget
    scroll wheel on tab bar?
    Add a fake ssh_askpass for when $SSH_ASKPASS is unset so we can only error out on that when needed
    Fix charsets_in and chatset_out setting

Bugs:
    Can't set colors for input from config as the cursor becomes hidden
    restoring colors from default doesn't work, the colors don't know they've been updated
    fix forking for windows, highlight script and link clicking mess up
    Make sure of elegant fallbacks when irssi2 fails to connect
    Non UTF characters result in blank lines

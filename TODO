TODO

Big things:
    Dynamic scrollback fetching
    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Fixup the Net::SSH connection method for windows lusers
    Finish porting rirc to windows (if I can be bothered)
    Plugin support?
    Network/Presence/channel config GUI
	
Little things:
    network buffers should also maybe do event get
    Make the right click menus more useful
    Make keybindings configurable
    NetSplit detection (might be better in irssi2 itself)
    Hide/Disconnect/Disconnect & Close All right click options for network tabs.

Bugs:
    Selected text in the textview changes color when the textview isn't in focus, an ugly workaround hack is keeping this looking nice for now tho.
    Slight issues with scrolling to end when tab switching.

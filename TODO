TODO

Big things:
	Configuration GUI
	Store configuration locally (maybe in YAML) and on the server (once it stores persistantly)
	Dynamic scrollback fetching
	On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
	Investigate puggybacking ssh binary rather then using ruby module
	
Little things:
	/msgs from other users should open a new tab at the end of the channel list for that network
	network buffers should also maybe do event get
	Fix the hideous color scheme
	Search the logs to find user's hostname for event get events like /part and /join
	
Bugs:
	Coloring text inserting at the beginning of the buffer b0rks if timestamps are disabled(maybe need to insert the whole line and THEN tag it rather then inserting and tagging pieces)
	Remove newline after the scrollback buffer
	You can untoggle the channel buttons without selecting a new channel
	#SSH connection code lacks exception handling

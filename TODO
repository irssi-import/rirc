TODO

Big things:
    Dynamic scrollback fetching
    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Intelligent assignment of tabs to windows(either by some user-set filters, or by some intelligent pattern recognizing magick)
    
Little things:
   add a irssi0 style activity bar as an alternative to the other Tablistviews
   reimplement tab numbering
   make the tab selected after the current one is closed try to find a channel and not just the next one to the left
   fix error parsing
   Add more BufferList positioning options(add a Vpaned on the left)
   
Bugs:
    Can't set colors for input from config as the cursor becomes hidden
    Catch kicks, and fix quit events to show the type of quit (part/kick/quit)
    Tab right click menus don't work properly, provide a unified way to disconnect/part/close
    Missing user inits (might be icecap's problem)
    clean up the quit code

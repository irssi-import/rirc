    On the fly replacement of user message timestamps and hostnames in event buffer as info is recieved from the server
    Intelligent assignment of tabs to windows(either by some user-set filters, or by some intelligent pattern recognizing magick)
    
Little things:
   Add right click menus for tabs
   reimplement the TreeView tablist
   add a irssi0 style activity bar as an alternative to the other Tablistviews
   reimplement tab numbering
   make the tab selected after the current one is closed try to find a channel and not just the next one to the left
